## Feedback Log

### From Butter
**Feedback:** "Add an option to linger in silence (Just sad reflection text)"

**Status:** Included

**Implementation:** Added "Linger in Silence" choice to 8 scenes. Shows random sad reflections with melancholic text based on ingredient count.

**Feedback:** "If you linger in all the silences change the final screen to be more melancholy like the silences as a hand reaches towards you, you are now whole but at what cost."

**Status:** Included

**Implementation:** When all 5 unique silence messages are seen, ending changes to: "A hand reaches towards you. You are now whole. But at what cost? 🧈"

**Feedback:** "If you get the creepy ending but have the avocado it should be a good ending. The hand comes to you but goes away. You hear loud overhead ew."

**Status:** Included

**Implementation:** Added avocado to window_sill room in living_room. If player has avocado and triggers secret ending (lingered in all silences), the hand pulls back with "Ew" reaction overhead, resulting in a good ending where the player remains whole and free.
